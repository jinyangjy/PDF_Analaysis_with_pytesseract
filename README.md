<h1>Analysing multiple files with Tesseract-OCR</h1>
The script 'analyse_multiple_files' is used to extract text content from multiple PDF files using Tesseract OCR. The Tesseract OCR command path and the path of the Poppler application must first be configured. We'll then need to use the 'pdf2image' library to convert each PDF file into an image file. Each imageÂ is then saved with its corresponding filename in a temporary directory. Moving on, the text is extracted and written to a specified text file from each of the image files, and the text from these image files are extracted using the Tesseract OCR engine 'pytesseract.image_to_string'. The process will then be repeated for each PDF file.

For each PDF file, a seperate temporary directory is created, and the PDF is converted into a list of image files. The image processing function are then mapped to the pool of worker processes, while using the "pool.map" function from python's multiprocessing library. This will allow multiple PDF files to be processed concurrently, with each worker process handling a different PDF file 1, 2, and 3. The pool of workers will be responsible to process the image processing functions in parallel. Once all PDF Files have been processsed, the pool is closed.
